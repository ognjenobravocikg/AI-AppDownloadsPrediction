Final coursework for class Machine Learning.
The project was realized by students Ognjen Obradovic and Petar Jovic.

Dataset for training the model:

You can find the original code or version 1 on the original branch. This is a touched-up model, that produces better results and is more concise. Considering the model is too big to be put on Github you can run and train it yourself, by running training.py.
